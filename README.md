Project Name - Artist personal website.

Project Overwiew:

The project aims to create better visibility on the artist and provide clear level of expectations in relation to artists work.
The website is clean, easy to navigate and a useful resource for both the visitor and site owner.
Whilst the visitor can only check the work and evaluate it in their thoughts, the website also has a contact page which can be useful to get in touch with the artist
and gain communication. 

The project has been designed with Mobile First approach in mind, so it can be viewed on the go or while sitting at home.
The artist (owner) has an ability to expand or replace their work in the gallery if they wish to do so. 

The communication is being handled via website form and the message is being sent to the owner mailbox.
The page offers a selection of information about the artist which can be useful if one is looking to find a person localy.

UX:

The website has been mainly designed for visitors. I have tried to go for a pure/clean look and easy navigation which does not require pixel search.
This project aims to raise popularity and provide visibility for the artist. 
The website can be used to show case recent or portforlio work, provide personal details that the owner is willing to show and communication with the artist. This will provide an opportunity for future employment.
The project can and perhaps will be upgraded with new features in the future. The features can be added as additional pages or added onto the current ones.

In order to achieve and gain experience for the idea, I have reseached websites that are hosted by artists.

This gave me some ideas to think about and finily I got my first idea of how the website should look like and created a wireframe using the service - https://marvelapp.com/.

This became my first stepping stone.


Features

Feature 1 - Home page/Main page allows users to quickly navigate through the website.
The Home page has a clean/fresh look and is easy to navigate and adjust to. 

Some cool effects have been added to worm up the user experience.

Feature 2 - Gallery page allows the users to view the content such as artist work for their own enjoyment or satisfaction.
The page once again has a strict policy of beaing clean and easy to use. 

The images will be shown in grid and a sweet hover effect will provide the user with larger scale of an image they wish to preview. 
The idea of creating a carousel or a slideshow proven to be a little bit distracting when visiting the website.

Feature 3 - about page allows the users to gain information about the artist and link to other social media platforms which have been listed. 

Feature 4 - contact page allows the users to leave their name, email address and the message which will be sent to the artist. If you're looking to communicate this feature is for you!


Future project enhancement plan:

Add a feature which would allow a user to submit an order for artist to work on. 
For now, all features that have been thought of and approved have been added for user interaction. 


Deployment

The main personal objective was to make the project work and be user friendly.
While making first steps, the project has been modified few times and some features have been removed due to complexity.

Whilst working on the project I regularly have been using GitHub to back-up my date in case something happens.
Since the project has been open for public view and opinio from time to time I was checking on potential commennts. 

In the hour of strugle the main resource that gave me back the inspiration and some knowledge of how to fix an issue or how come there is a bug was W3S school. 

Great potential and big library of cool and useful features to try when developing a project. It's my recommendation of the day! 
One of the main questions or challenges for myself was a question of using the Boostrap framework or leave it and make everything manually. Ofcourse, manually sounds way to harsh since all the developers are using Google Fonts, libraries with shared codes for ideas or inspiration. 
Still, my website has been done manually which I believe gave me a lot of experience and confidance in myself.

This time around, I skipped using Bootstrap however, I do acknowledge why it's one of the popular frameworks on the market.

Other than this, I would like to mention that most of the applicable tools and platforms used - Cloud9, Google Chrome, GitHub and so on gave me an amazing experience while working on this project. 

Thanks!
